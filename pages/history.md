        <p>The Ateneo Lingua Ars Cultura started out in 2000 as a tutorial club for students taking Spanish classes, and since its accreditation in 2001, ALAC has been a certified cultural organization in the university. Its TURUAN Program was first organized in 2002 as a foreign language tutorial for public high school students. Currently, it is the only student organization in Loyola Schools that offers language tutorials and aims to produce culturally-sensitive students through striking cultural projects that provide experiential wisdom to the community.</p>
        
        <p>In 2009, ALAC restructured the organization to better bridge, experience and celebrate languages, arts and cultures within the Philippines and beyond its borders. In 2010, ALAC scored a B+ during their Year-End Report and thereby garnered the award for Most Improved Organization for SY 2009-2010. Believing in “quality over quantity,” ALAC designs few projects with big impacts on the community. These projects focus on the organization’s strength as a multilingual and artistically-talented organization, and aims to form culturally-sensitive members through learning languages and through reaching out to other cultural institutions in the country.</p>
