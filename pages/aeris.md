## Who is Aeris?

ALAC adopted Aeris to help YOU, our org members, with your concerns and questions. She will post announcements on the group page and handle the ALAC twitter account.

She is a scarlet macaw adopted from a reservation in South America where she was taken care of after her original habitat was destroyed. She has bright colorful feathers similar to the iridescent ALAC colors of red, blue, orange, and yellow. We chose to have a parrot because as smart birds, parrots are capable of mimicking sounds that people make. After all, ALAC seeks to experience languages right?

## Why a parrot?

Parrots are an intelligent species of aves, capable of mimicking sounds and learning phrases used in human communication. This is similar to how ALAC members learn a new language in Turuan.

Parrots are also very colorful birds, their feathers can range from green, blue, red, yellow, and white. The scarlet macaw, in particular, has red, blue, and yellow on it - just like the ALAC logo! The logo's colorful triangles promote our core values of diversity and inclusitivity. Since ALAC is not a home organization, we welcome members from the different courses in the Ateneo.

So come join Aeris and ALAC in bridging cultures, experiencing languages, and celebrating the arts!
